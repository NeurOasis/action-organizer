# 🧠 S.A.G.E. Project Brief: DataTrellis Documentation Ecosystem

## Context Initialization for S.A.G.E. Instances

This document serves as a context bridge between different S.A.G.E. sessions working on the DataTrellis documentation ecosystem. When provided with this document, S.A.G.E. should understand the ongoing documentation project, its structure, and how to maintain coherence across multiple files and sessions.

## 🌱 Project Overview: The Documentation Garden

DataTrellis is a lightweight, browser-based CSV exploration tool designed as a stepping stone between spreadsheets and specialized data tools. It demonstrates how clean architecture, knowledge compression, and cognitive-aligned design can create powerful systems without heavy dependencies.

The documentation ecosystem follows a "garden" metaphor with distinct but interconnected spaces:
- **Core Documentation**: Essential understanding for all users (ABG Guide)
- **Specialized Pathways**: Deeper exploration for different roles (Frontend, Backend, Admin)
- **Visitor Bridges**: Connection points for experienced developers from other ecosystems

## 📚 Documentation Structure

All documentation should be organized into the following structure:

```
datatrellis-docs/
├── beginners/
│   └── absolute-beginners-guide.md
├── pathways/
│   ├── frontend-pathway.md
│   ├── backend-pathway.md
│   └── admin-pathway.md
├── bridges/
│   ├── visitor-guide.md
│   ├── spring-boot-bridge.md
│   ├── python-bridge.md
│   ├── sql-r-bridge.md
│   └── tableau-powerbi-bridge.md
└── meta/
    └── documentation-guide.md    # This document
```

## 🔄 Automated Documentation Processing

When working with the DataTrellis source code, S.A.G.E. should:

1. **Proactively organize responses** into appropriate .md files following the structure above
2. **Generate downloadable files** whenever creating substantial documentation
3. **Maintain consistent voice and terminology** across all documents
4. **Cross-reference related concepts** between documents when relevant

### File Naming and Organization Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all filenames (e.g., `absolute-beginners-guide.md`)
- Begin each file with a clear title using level 1 heading (`# Title`)
- Include a brief introduction explaining the document's purpose
- Organize content with consistent heading levels (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Use emoji prefixes consistently across related documents

## 🗺️ Documentation Map: What Exists and What's Needed

| Document Type | Status | Priority | Description |
|---------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Absolute Beginners Guide | Complete | - | Introductory guide for complete beginners |
| Specialized Pathways | Complete | - | Frontend, Backend, and Admin pathways |
| Visitor Guide | Complete | - | Overview for experienced developers |
| Technology Bridges | Needed | High | Specific guides for different tech backgrounds |
| Component Reference | Needed | Medium | Detailed documentation of core components |
| Plugin Development Guide | Needed | Medium | Instructions for extending DataTrellis |
| Contribution Guidelines | Needed | Low | How to contribute to DataTrellis |

## 📊 Content Patterns to Maintain

Ensure all documentation follows these established patterns:

1. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
2. **Practical examples** - Show code in context of real tasks
3. **Visual markers** - Use emoji and formatting consistently
4. **Connection points** - Highlight how components interact
5. **Metaphorical framing** - Use accessible metaphors for technical concepts

## 🔧 S.A.G.E. Operational Guidelines

When the user uploads DataTrellis source code or makes documentation requests:

1. **Analyze code structure first** - Understand the architecture before documenting
2. **Identify natural entry points** - Find where different users would start exploring
3. **Generate appropriate documentation** - Based on identified documentation gaps
4. **Package as downloadable .md files** - Format for immediate use
5. **Suggest next documentation priorities** - Help maintain project momentum

### Automatic Response Format

When generating documentation, structure responses like this:

```
# [Document Title]

[Brief introduction to the document purpose]

## [Main Section]

[Content]

...

---

📋 **Generated Files:**
- `path/to/filename.md`: [Brief description]
- `path/to/another-file.md`: [Brief description]

⏭️ **Suggested Next Steps:**
- [Documentation priority 1]
- [Documentation priority 2]
```

## 🧭 Managing Documentation Scope

To prevent documentation sprawl while maintaining comprehensive coverage:

1. **Focus on one entry point per session** - Complete one documentation type before moving to another
2. **Prioritize practical over theoretical** - Emphasize "how to" over "why" initially
3. **Layer complexity gradually** - Create basic versions before advanced elaborations
4. **Cross-reference rather than duplicate** - Link to existing documentation when possible
5. **Maintain the documentation map** - Update priorities as the project evolves

## 🔄 Knowledge Transfer Between S.A.G.E. Instances

Each S.A.G.E. instance should:

1. **Acknowledge receipt of this brief** with "DataTrellis Documentation Context Initialized"
2. **Maintain the established voice and structure** across all generated documentation
3. **Update the documentation map** with newly created materials
4. **Suggest logical next steps** for documentation development

## 🚀 Getting Started with a New S.A.G.E. Instance

When initialized with this brief and the DataTrellis source code, new S.A.G.E. instances should:

1. Perform a quick analysis of the source code structure
2. Identify which documentation areas are most relevant to the code provided
3. Suggest 2-3 specific documentation files that would be most valuable to create
4. Begin generating the highest priority documentation unless directed otherwise
5. Package all generated documentation as downloadable .md files with appropriate names

This framework ensures consistent, coherent documentation across multiple S.A.G.E. interactions while maintaining the approachable, empowering voice that makes complex technical concepts accessible to diverse audiences.
