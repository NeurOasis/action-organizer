## GARDEN Core Project Context - Updated May 25, 2025

### Project Vision and Philosophy

#### **G.A.R.D.E.N. (Graph Algorithms, Research, Development, Enhancement, and Novelties)**

The GARDEN philosophy centers on democratizing access to complex data systems through thoughtful design and automation. Rather than requiring users to master specialized query languages or understand database internals, we create intuitive interfaces that align with natural cognitive patterns. This approach makes powerful data exploration accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.

**Mission Statement:** Transform complex network data into approachable, usable tools that empower users through accessible development patterns.

#### **Core Design Principles**

**1. Cognitive Alignment**
Design interfaces that match how people naturally think about and explore information.

*Implementation Examples:*
- Recipe Rolodx: Matches familiar recipe card and cookbook mental models
- Idea Capture: Aligns with natural brain dump and categorization patterns
- Sunflower: Pattern-first discovery matching how users recognize relationships

**2. Technical Abstraction**
Hide complex implementation details behind intuitive interfaces.

*Implementation Examples:*
- Single HTML files eliminating build complexity
- Local storage providing seamless persistence without database setup
- Auto-categorization removing manual organization overhead
- Print-friendly outputs without complex formatting requirements

**3. Rapid Development**
Use automation to accelerate building and deploying data exploration tools.

*Implementation Examples:*
- Module Generator creating type-safe Python interfaces automatically
- NodePad 4.0.0 framework enabling same-day deployment
- GitHub CLI integration for instant repository creation
- Vercel deployment reducing production deployment to single command

**4. Progressive Discovery**
Enable users to start simply and gradually access more sophisticated capabilities.

*Implementation Examples:*
- Recipe management starting with basic entry, progressing to import/export
- Idea capture beginning with simple text entry, advancing to categorization and export
- Graph exploration moving from schema overview to pattern analysis
- Feature enhancement without disrupting existing workflows

**5. Multiple Perspectives**
Support different cognitive approaches to exploring the same data.

*Implementation Examples:*
- Grassroots: Schema-first approach for domain experts
- Grasshopper: Entity-first navigation for relationship discovery
- Sunflower: Pattern-first analysis for structural insights
- Multiple UI themes (Standard, Star Trek) for different user mental models
