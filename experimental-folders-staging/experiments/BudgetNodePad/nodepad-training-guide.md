# NodePad Training Guide & Budget Application Extension

## 🎯 Overview: Understanding NodePad

NodePad represents a graph-based approach to information management that aligns perfectly with the G.A.R.D.E.N. philosophy of accessible development. Based on the pattern of similar tools, NodePad likely follows these core principles:

### Core Concepts
- **Nodes**: Individual pieces of information (notes, concepts, data points)
- **Edges**: Relationships between nodes (connections, dependencies, flows)
- **Graph Structure**: The overall network of interconnected information
- **LLM Integration**: AI assistance for content generation and relationship discovery

## 📊 Cognitive Framework Application

### Grassroots Approach (Structure-First)
```
Budget Categories
├── Income Sources
│   ├── Primary Income
│   └── Secondary Income
├── Fixed Expenses
│   ├── Housing
│   ├── Insurance
│   └── Debt Payments
└── Variable Expenses
    ├── Food & Dining
    ├── Transportation
    └── Entertainment
```

### Grasshopper Approach (Example-First)
```
[Grocery Receipt] ──→ [Food Category] ──→ [Monthly Food Budget]
       ↑                    ↓                     ↓
       └──── [Store Analysis] ──→ [Shopping Patterns]
```

### Sunflower Approach (Pattern-First)
```
Spending Pattern Alpha        Pattern Beta
[Weekend Splurges]           [End-of-Month Stress]
[Impulse Purchases]          [Bill Clustering]
[Social Spending]            [Income Timing Issues]
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Node Structure for Budget Data

**Basic Node Types:**
- **Transaction Node**: Individual financial transactions
- **Category Node**: Budget categories and subcategories
- **Account Node**: Bank accounts, credit cards, cash
- **Goal Node**: Financial goals and targets
- **Timeline Node**: Date-based organization

**Node Properties:**
```javascript
{
  id: "unique_identifier",
  type: "transaction|category|account|goal|timeline",
  title: "Human readable name",
  amount: 0.00,
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  metadata: {
    // Type-specific properties
  }
}
```

### 2. Relationship Types

**Financial Relationships:**
- **BELONGS_TO**: Transaction belongs to category
- **PAID_FROM**: Transaction paid from account
- **CONTRIBUTES_TO**: Transaction contributes to goal
- **OCCURRED_ON**: Transaction occurred on date
- **BUDGETED_FOR**: Category has budget allocation
- **TRANSFERS_TO**: Account-to-account transfers

### 3. Core Features Extension

#### A. Smart Transaction Categorization
```javascript
// LLM-assisted categorization
function categorizeTransaction(description, amount, merchant) {
  return {
    suggestedCategory: "Food & Dining",
    confidence: 0.85,
    reasoning: "Restaurant merchant pattern detected",
    alternatives: ["Entertainment", "Business Meals"]
  };
}
```

#### B. Pattern Recognition
```javascript
// Identify spending patterns
function detectSpendingPatterns(transactions) {
  return [
    {
      pattern: "Weekend Surge",
      description: "30% higher spending on weekends",
      recommendation: "Consider weekend spending limits"
    },
    {
      pattern: "Subscription Clustering",
      description: "Multiple subscriptions renew on 1st",
      recommendation: "Spread renewal dates across month"
    }
  ];
}
```

#### C. Goal Tracking Visualization
```javascript
// Visual goal progress
function createGoalProgress(goalNode, relatedTransactions) {
  return {
    goalName: goalNode.title,
    targetAmount: goalNode.metadata.target,
    currentAmount: calculateProgress(relatedTransactions),
    projectedCompletion: predictCompletion(relatedTransactions),
    recommendations: generateGoalTips(goalNode, relatedTransactions)
  };
}
```
