# GARDEN Repository Audit Checklist - Enhanced with Chat Archaeology

## PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE PRESERVATION (Critical - Do First!)

### Save Artifacts from Interrupted Conversation ⚠️
- [ ] Save Backlog Manager: `toolshed/garden-backlog-manager.html`
- [ ] Save Version History: `toolshed/garden-version-history.html`
- [ ] Save this checklist: `AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` (repo root)
- [ ] Update `CIT_GARDEN_ProjectManagement.md` with current state
- [ ] Create `CURRENT_STATUS.md` documenting what's real vs conceptual

### Document Strategic Decisions
- [ ] Garden Grafter naming (was Enhanced Garden Uploader)
- [ ] Lightweight core + forked projects strategy
- [ ] Single-page-no-dependencies ethos
- [ ] Full-repo project knowledge approach

## PHASE 2: CHAT ARCHAEOLOGY (Systematic Extraction)

### Process: Newest to Oldest Chat Review
For each GARDEN-related conversation, working from most recent to oldest:

1. **Extract Phase**
   - [ ] Pull latest artifacts and save to repo
   - [ ] Document insights not yet captured in CITs
   - [ ] Extract backlog items not in current system  
   - [ ] Note architectural decisions and rationale
   - [ ] Capture implementation details

2. **Compare Phase**
   - [ ] Compare extracted items to current core files
   - [ ] Check against current backlog system
   - [ ] Identify gaps in documentation
   - [ ] Flag duplicate or conflicting information

3. **Integrate Phase**
   - [ ] Add new items to appropriate systems
   - [ ] Update relevant CITs with findings
   - [ ] Resolve conflicts and duplications
   - [ ] Document source conversation for reference

4. **Archive Phase**
   - [ ] Mark conversation as "Mined and Archived"
   - [ ] Note key contributions in version history
   - [ ] Remove from active reference list

### Target Conversations (In Order)
- [ ] Latest interrupted conversation (this recovery)
- [ ] Garden Grafter development sessions
- [ ] Backlog Manager creation
- [ ] CIT consolidation discussions
- [ ] NodePad development conversations
- [ ] Original GARDEN philosophy conversations

## PHASE 3: REPOSITORY STRUCTURE AUDIT

### Core Repository Assessment
- [ ] List all files currently in root
- [ ] Categorize: Core vs Project-Specific vs Experimental
- [ ] Identify files for migration to forks
- [ ] Check for duplicate content

### Project Migration Planning
**Move to Forked Repositories:**
- [ ] Sailing projects (SailPlan + SailingWatch → fork)
- [ ] Zach context and visual schedule → fork  
- [ ] Budget NodePad → fork
- [ ] Coffee recipe project → fork
- [ ] Brand standards → fork
- [ ] Individual NodePad applications → forks

### Core Preservation
**Keep in Core Repository:**
- [ ] GARDEN philosophy and documentation
- [ ] CIT templates and core contexts
- [ ] Module generators and infrastructure
- [ ] Toolshed (foundational tools)
- [ ] README and contributing guidelines

## PHASE 4: BACKLOG CONSOLIDATION

### Mobile Lightning Capture Items
From screenshots captured:
- [ ] Move more out of core app before other ideas
- [ ] Backlog auto-linking system
- [ ] Star Trek styling enhancement  
- [ ] NodePad expense tracking
- [ ] Core app as documentation frontend
- [ ] Fix mobile export function issue

### Dan Conversation Strategic Items  
From Saturday conversation:
- [ ] Business strategy messaging for each project
- [ ] Data integration contract business model
- [ ] Service provider positioning strategy
- [ ] Voice-to-NodePad development
- [ ] Single file sharing system
- [ ] "Dummy user" onboarding approach

### Chat Archaeology Findings
- [ ] Items discovered during systematic chat review
- [ ] Categorize by project and priority
- [ ] Integrate with existing backlog
- [ ] Remove duplicates

## PHASE 5: FORK CREATION WORKFLOW

### Garden Grafter Deployment
- [ ] Test current Garden Grafter functionality
- [ ] Create first project fork using it
- [ ] Validate DNA copying and project creation
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed

### Project Fork Creation
For each project identified for migration:
- [ ] Use Garden Grafter to create project fork
- [ ] Copy relevant CIT and documentation
- [ ] Set up independent development environment
- [ ] Remove from core repository
- [ ] Update core documentation with fork references

## PHASE 6: DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP

### CIT System Optimization
- [ ] Implement simplified naming (no dates in filenames)
- [ ] Use version history for tracking changes
- [ ] Consolidate related CITs where appropriate
- [ ] Move behind-the-scenes CITs to main contexts folder

### README and Core Documentation
- [ ] Update main README with current architecture
- [ ] Document fork strategy and workflow
- [ ] Create quick start guide for contributors
- [ ] Update contributing guidelines

## PHASE 7: TESTING AND VALIDATION

### Full Repository Test
- [ ] Clone fresh copy of repository
- [ ] Verify all core functionality works
- [ ] Test Garden Grafter project creation
- [ ] Validate fork workflow end-to-end

### Project Knowledge Test
- [ ] Upload clean repository to Claude as project knowledge
- [ ] Verify all essential context is preserved
- [ ] Test new conversation startup without chat history
- [ ] Document any missing context or instructions

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

✅ **Repository Ready**: Core is lightweight, focused, and self-documenting
✅ **Context Preserved**: New Claude conversations can start effectively without chat history  
✅ **Projects Migrated**: All project-specific work moved to appropriate forks
✅ **Backlog Unified**: All ideas and tasks captured in persistent systems
✅ **Documentation Complete**: Everything exists as files, not just conversation concepts
✅ **Workflow Tested**: Garden Grafter and fork strategy proven functional

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Execute Phase 1** (Immediate Preservation) - 15 minutes
2. **Begin Phase 2** (Chat Archaeology) - Start with most recent conversations
3. **Create status checkpoint** - Document progress after each phase
4. **Test frequently** - Ensure nothing breaks during cleanup

## EMERGENCY RECOVERY

If something goes wrong during audit:
- [ ] Backup exists of pre-audit state
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Critical artifacts saved independently
- [ ] Can restore to known good state
