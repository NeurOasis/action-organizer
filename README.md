# Graph Algorithms, Research, Development, Enhancements, and Novelties (G.A.R.D.E.N.)

A repository for various excursions into:

- Graph databases, graph modeling, graph development
- Algorithm development, benchmarking, testing, comparison
- Research into new methods for working with graph data
- Development of new, self-contained graph products
- Enhancements to existing graph products, such as neo4j plugins.
- Novel graph development efforts just because they're neat.
