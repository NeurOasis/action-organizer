# GARDEN Repository Audit - Recovery Notes
*Updated: 2025-05-26*

## Current Audit Status
- **Progress**: Phase 1 preservation mostly complete
- **Project Knowledge**: 86% (CRITICAL - target <50%)
- **Primary Goal**: Systematic CIT consolidation and content migration

## Completed This Session
✅ Symlink access attempted (garden-link created on Desktop)
✅ Identified key CIT overlaps for consolidation
✅ Version Control + Corporate Strategy CIT ready for consolidation
✅ Backlog Manager and Version History tools created

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Fix File Access**: Resolve symlink or copy key CITs to Desktop for analysis
2. **CIT Consolidation**: Merge overlapping contexts systematically
3. **Content Migration**: Move project-specific content to forks
4. **Repository Cleanup**: Achieve <50% project knowledge target

## CITs Identified for Consolidation

### High Priority Consolidations
- **Version Control + Corporate Strategy** → Move to corpStrat/ folder
- **Brand Style Guide + ADA Compliance** → Create minimal core standards, fork detailed guides
- **Meta-CIT Framework + GARDEN Core** → Remove overlap, keep methodologies separate

### Content to Fork Out
- Personal contexts (keep for your development, but not core GARDEN)
- Brand standards projects (need development work)  
- ADA compliance details (keep minimal standards in core)
- Project-specific contexts (sailing, recipes, etc.)

## Technical Notes
- Symlink created as `garden-link` on Desktop
- Direct file access needed for precise overlap analysis
- RECOVERY_NOTES.md was empty - this artifact updates it

## If Interrupted Again
1. Check this file for current status
2. Priority: Complete CIT consolidations first
3. Use AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md for systematic progress
4. Target: <50% project knowledge before other development

## Key Decision
**Recovery Notes Purpose**: Document audit progress to enable seamless continuation across conversation interruptions.
