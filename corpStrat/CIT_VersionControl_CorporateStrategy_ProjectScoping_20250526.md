## üìÅ File Naming Conventions & Version Control

### Context Initialization Templates
All Context Initialization Templates (CITs) will follow this naming convention:
- Format: "CIT_ProjectName_YYYYMMDD.md"
- Examples:
  - `CIT_VersionControl_CorporateStrategy_ProjectScoping_20250526.md`
  - `CIT_GARDEN_20250525.md`
  - `CIT_SailPlan_20250511.md`

CITs should not include version numbers as they represent the current state of context as of a specific date.

### Project Files (Version-Controlled Documents)
All project files will follow this naming convention:
- Format: "ProjectName_Description with spaces_vX.Y_YYYYMMDD.md"
- Examples:
  - `SailPlan_Project Guide_v1.0_20250426.md`
  - `GARDEN_Technical Specification_v1.2_20250405.md`
  - `Actions_QuickRef_Concise_v1.3_20250510.md`

Version numbering:
- X.0 (like v1.0, v2.0): Complete releases or major revisions
- X.Y (like v1.1, v1.2): Interim updates or minor revisions

### Document & Print Standards
- **Digital Documents**: Responsive design, 16px minimum font, semantic structure
- **Printed Materials**: 4x6 index cards (landscape), 12pt minimum font, ADA compliant contrast
- **Default Format**: Markdown (.md) for all documentation unless specific features require other formats

## üè¢ Corporate Strategy Project Scoping

### GARDEN Project Positioning
**Core Value Proposition**: Democratizing access to complex data systems through cognitive-aligned interfaces

**Strategic Positioning Options**:
1. **Open Source Community Leader** - MIT license, community-driven development
2. **Enterprise Integration Partner** - Custom implementations for organizations
3. **Educational Technology Provider** - Tools for learning graph database concepts
4. **Consulting and Services** - Implementation and training services

### Project Scope Management

#### Core GARDEN Repository Scope (Lightweight)
**Keep in Core**:
- GARDEN philosophy and documentation
- CIT templates and core contexts
- Module generators and infrastructure
- Toolshed (foundational tools only)
- README and contributing guidelines

**Move to Forks**:
- Personal projects (sailing, visual schedules, recipes)
- Brand standards and marketing materials
- Experimental features and proof-of-concepts
- User-specific contexts and configurations
- Corporate strategy development

#### Business Model Frameworks

**Revenue Stream Analysis**:
- **Open Source Foundation**: MIT license enables unlimited commercial use
- **Professional Services**: Implementation, training, custom development
- **Enterprise Support**: Priority support, custom features, integration services
- **Educational Licensing**: Specialized packages for academic institutions

**Market Positioning**:
- **vs. Neo4j Enterprise**: More accessible, cognitive-aligned interfaces
- **vs. Gephi/Cytoscape**: Better non-technical user experience
- **vs. Custom Development**: Faster time-to-value, proven patterns
- **vs. Business Intelligence Tools**: Specialized for graph/relationship data

### Project Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Repository Cleanup (Immediate)
- Move corpStrat/ folder to dedicated repository
- Fork brand standards and ADA compliance projects
- Extract personal contexts to user-specific repositories
- Consolidate overlapping CITs

#### Phase 2: Market Positioning (Next Quarter)
- Develop enterprise value propositions
- Create case studies and success stories
- Establish pricing models for services
- Build partner and integration ecosystem

#### Phase 3: Scale Operations (Next Year)
- Professional services team development
- Enterprise sales and marketing infrastructure
- Community management and contribution workflows
- Advanced feature development for enterprise clients

### Version Retention Policy
- **During Major Development**: Retain all interim versions
- **After Major Release**: Keep previous major + delete old interim versions
- **Long-term**: Maintain major milestone versions only
- **Documentation**: All decisions tracked in version history artifacts

### Success Metrics
- **Repository Size**: Target <50% project knowledge for core
- **Project Clarity**: Clear separation between core and user projects
- **Market Position**: Established value propositions for each market segment
- **Development Velocity**: Faster iteration through focused scope

### Integration with GARDEN Ecosystem
- **CIT System**: Templates support both technical and business contexts
- **Fork Strategy**: Business development can proceed independently of core
- **Community Building**: Open source foundation supports commercial growth
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent approach across all business materials

## ü§ñ Note for Claude
This consolidated CIT serves dual purposes:
- **Technical**: Version control standards for all GARDEN projects
- **Business**: Strategic scoping and positioning for commercial development
- **Migration**: Clear guidelines for moving business strategy out of core repository
- **Standards**: Consistent documentation and development practices

When working on either technical version control or business strategy:
- Reference this CIT for naming conventions and scope management
- Use fork strategy to keep core repository lightweight
- Apply business positioning frameworks to new opportunities
- Maintain clear separation between open source core and commercial applications
