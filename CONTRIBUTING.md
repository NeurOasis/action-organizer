# CONTRIBUTING to G.A.R.D.E.N.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to G.A.R.D.E.N. (Graph Algorithms, Research, Development, Enhancement, and Novelties). This document outlines the process for contributing to the project and our branching strategy.

## Branch Management

The G.A.R.D.E.N. project uses the following branch management approach:

- The **main branch** is protected and curated by the core development team
- All contributions are made through dedicated feature or fix branches
- Contributors are encouraged to create and maintain their own branches for development

### Main Branch Protection

The main branch represents the official, reviewed, and tested version of G.A.R.D.E.N. All code in this branch:

- Has been reviewed by the core development team
- Meets our coding standards and quality requirements
- Has passed all required tests
- Is documented according to project standards

### Contributing Your Work

We welcome contributions in several forms:

1. **Feature branches**: Implement new features or applications within the G.A.R.D.E.N. ecosystem
2. **Fix branches**: Address bugs or issues in existing code
3. **Documentation branches**: Improve documentation, examples, or tutorials
4. **Experimental branches**: Explore new approaches that might be incorporated later

All contributions should follow this process:

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name:
   - Features: `feature/your-feature-name`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/issue-being-fixed`
   - Documentation: `docs/what-youre-documenting`
   - Experiments: `experimental/your-experiment`
3. **Develop your contribution** on your branch
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Submit a pull request** from your branch to our main branch
6. **Respond to feedback** from the core team during the review process

## Review Process

The core team will review all pull requests against these criteria:

- Alignment with G.A.R.D.E.N. philosophy and goals
- Code quality and adherence to project standards
- Test coverage and passing tests
- Documentation quality
- Overall value to the ecosystem

We may request changes before merging your contribution into the main branch. This review process ensures that G.A.R.D.E.N. maintains high quality and consistency.

## Maintaining Your Own Branches

We encourage contributors to maintain their own branches in addition to submitting pull requests:

- **Experimental implementations** that might not be ready for the main branch
- **Domain-specific adaptations** that serve particular use cases
- **Alternative approaches** to problems that offer different trade-offs
- **Extended functionality** that builds upon the core framework

These branches can be valuable to the community even if they are not merged into the main branch. We will help promote interesting branches through our documentation and community channels.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance with your contribution:

- Open an issue with questions about implementation details
- Join our community discussions
- Reach out to core team members for guidance

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which promotes a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community.

## Licensing

By contributing to G.A.R.D.E.N., you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.

Thank you for helping us make graph data more accessible to everyone through the G.A.R.D.E.N. ecosystem!
